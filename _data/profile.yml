  <strong>SEÂ² â€” Software Engineering Research Group II</strong> at the
  <em>Department of Computer Science (DCC)</em>,
  <strong>Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile</strong>.
  My research focuses on <strong>software engineering</strong> â€” I love building
  tools that help developers understand, test, and evolve complex systems.
  Recently, Iâ€™ve been exploring automated code generation, software mining
  repositories, and AI-driven approaches for software testing and maintenance.  </p>
